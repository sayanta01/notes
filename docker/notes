Docker is a Company who Provides Containerization
docker server runs on linux virtual machine
sirf website ko host krne jitni resources extract krta h, does not create full os

( dockerfile )   is a blueprint for building docker image
( docker image ) is a template for running docker container, contains filesystem snapshot + startup command
( container )    is just a running process

( namespacing ) - isolation of resources means divides resources of machine
( control groups ) - limit resources per process

docker run = docker create + docker start
sudo docker create hello-world    - gives hash string, does create container 
sudo docker start -a "hash string"    - start container, "-a" attach to the container and give output of container


( Commands )
sudo docker run ubuntu ls    - overwrite statup command
sudo docker ps -a    - list of all running containers
sudo docker images    - check docker images
sudo docker stop "Container id"   - stop the container politely, gives SIGTERM signal "Terminate" to process
sudo docker kill "Container id"   - kill the container, gives SIGKILL signal "Forced Termination" to process
sudo docker logs "Container id"    - peek in the container 
sudo docker exec -it "Container id" sh    - run another command in container
