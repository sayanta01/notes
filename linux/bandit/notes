(What is hexdump)
#hexdump is a hexadecimal view (on screen or paper) of computer data.
#hexdump of data is usually done in the context of either debugging or reverse engineering. 
#in a hexdump, each byte (8 bits) is represented as a two-digit hexadecimal number. 
#hex dumps are commonly organized into rows of 8 or 16 bytes, sometimes separated by whitespaces. 
#some hex dumps have the hexadecimal memory address at the beginning.
